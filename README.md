## About
This project is a cross-platform chat application built with Flutter. It focuses on a clean and modular architecture, real-time messaging, secure authentication and a good developer experience for adding new features quickly.

## Tech stack
- Flutter (Dart)
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore / Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, Cloud Messaging)
- State management: Provider / Riverpod / Bloc (choose based on repo implementation)
- Navigation: Navigator 2.0 or Flutter's built-in Navigator
- Platform support: Android, iOS (web optional)
- CI: GitHub Actions (recommended)
- Tools: Git, VS Code / Android Studio

> Replace the state-management and navigation names above with the exact libraries used in your repo (e.g., Riverpod, flutter_bloc, get_it, go_router) for accuracy.

## Core features
- Email/password + social sign-in (Google, Apple) authentication
- Real-time 1:1 chat (text, images, attachments)
- Typing indicators, read receipts, online presence
- Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Profile management (avatar, display name, status)
- Searchable conversation list
- Message deletion and edit (optional)
- Offline support and message synchronization
- Responsive UI with light/dark theme support

## Screenshots / Demo
Include screenshots or a short demo GIF here.

```
Add your screenshots to the repository (e.g., /assets/screenshots/) and reference them here.
```

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK >= 3.x (check your project's minimum SDK in pubspec.yaml)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- Firebase project (console.firebase.google.com)
- Android Studio or Xcode for native builds
- Node.js (optional, if you use any local dev tooling)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Configure Firebase (see the next section) and add platform-specific files.

4. Run the app
```bash
# Android
flutter run -d android

# iOS
flutter run -d ios
```

## Firebase / Backend configuration

This project expects a Firebase backend. Typical setup steps:

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/.
2. Add Android and/or iOS apps in the Firebase console.
3. Download and place platform files:
   - Android: android/app/google-services.json
   - iOS: ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
4. Enable Firebase Authentication providers you want to use (Email, Google, Apple).
5. Create a Firestore database (or Realtime Database) and set security rules.
6. (Optional) Enable Cloud Storage for user-uploaded media.
7. Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.

Environment variables / config (example keys that may be required)
```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
```
If your repo uses a `.env` file or flutter_dotenv, add these keys there. Never commit secrets to the repository.

## Project structure (recommended / example)
```
/lib
  /src
    /models
    /services       
    /providers    
    /screens
    /widgets
    /utils
/main.dart
/assets
/android
/ios
/test
```
Adjust this section to reflect your repo's actual structure.

## Architecture & patterns
- Separation of UI, state, and services for testability
- Services layer: single responsibility wrappers around Firebase operations
- Dependency injection via get_it or providers
- Use of immutable models and DTOs for serialization

## State management
Document which approach the repo uses (Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, MobX, etc.) and include quick examples on how features interact with state:
```dart
// example: using Provider
final chatProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider((_) => ChatProvider());
```

## Messaging model (example)
- Collection: users
- Collection: conversations -> messages
- Message doc: { id, senderId, text, timestamp, type, status }
- Use composite indexes for queries if needed.

## Notifications
- Use Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver notifications when the app is in background/terminated.
- On message tap, navigate to the specific chat screen by passing conversationId.

## Security
- Use Firebase security rules to validate reads/writes (ensure only participants can access conversations).
- Validate file uploads and sanitize filenames.
- Require server-side checks for sensitive operations if you add any custom cloud functions.

## Testing
- Unit tests for service and model logic: /test
- Widget tests for key screens
- Integration tests (flutter_driver or integration_test) for end-to-end flows
- Run tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

## CI / CD (suggested)
- Use GitHub Actions to run tests and analyzer on pull requests
- Publish APK / IPA via Codemagic, GitHub Actions, or other CI providers
- Example checks: flutter analyze, flutter test, flutter format --set-exit-if-changed

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
3. Commit your changes: git commit -m "Add awesome feature"
4. Push to the branch: git push origin feature/awesome-feature
5. Open a pull request describing your changes

Please follow the repository's code style and include tests for new logic.

## Known issues & roadmap
- Add a short list of known limitations and upcoming features (group video calls, message reactions, improved offline UX, moderation tools).
